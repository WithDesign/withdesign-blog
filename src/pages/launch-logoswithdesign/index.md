Here at With Design we help many ambitious startups find and reach their hidden brand’s potential. Sometimes we find out that a full brand redesign is required. This includes creating a new logo for the brand.

After helping numerous high achieving startups, we realized that our hard drive were slowly piling up with too many logos that we had not yet used. As our computers were slowing down one day, it dawned on us… we realized that other brands and entrepreneurs could use these logos!

We love open source projects and supporting our community. Today we are proud to announce that we have made our library of unused logos completely free and open source!
